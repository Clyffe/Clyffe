**Hey there, I'm Jacob!**

I'm a front end developer from Houston, Texas. I focus heavily on Documentation Driven Development.

I mainly work with Python, Native Android with Java, and Native iOS with Swift. 

I can also work with most web app technologies, such as jQuery, PHP, Django, Bootstrap, and Sass.

I'm in between jobs at the moment, so I'm working on polishing my resume, and cleaning up years worth of projects to add to my Github.

Feel free to reach out to say hello!
